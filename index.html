        <p><em>User Experience & User Interface Designer at USAA</em></p>
        <p>I am a
          Product | UX | UI | Designer with a background in urban design, city planning and landscape architecture.
          My rigorous training in urban design has laid a strong design foundation allowing me to tackle
          design problems at varying
          scales, keeping the big
          picture in mind, but paying
          close attention to ne details.
          My work focuses on
          human-centered design
          processes which champion
          research, iteration, execution
          and delivery within
          cross-functional team
          settings. Working within this
          realm, I am a versatile
          designer who can perform
          technical and artistic
          assignments while always
          keeping the company‚Äôs goals
          in mind. I am resourceful, can
          adapt swiftly, and I thrive in
          collaborative environments
          where I am energized by a
          team‚Äôs creative pace &
          energy. I‚Äôm looking forward to
          share my background and
          experiences and contribute to create work that matters.
          Currently, I work as a I'm learning web and iOS development to compliment my design skillset.
          In my free time you can find me running the trails of the Texas Hill Country, visiting a local brewery with my wife and goldendoodle, or cheering on the lads of Liverpool FC.</p>

        Dorothy is an early stage, tech startup company that aims to repackage ood risk information and provide the necessary awareness
        and coverage for home owners & buyers and commercial real estate developers prior to a major hurricane or storm. In my role, I

        Cedar Rapids, Mexico & Egypt. During my time at SWA
        I applied discretion and independent judgement in helping to solve planning & design problems for our clients. I gathered and analyzed

        During my time as an intern, I coordinated with the design team and client group to iterate and test ideas of sense-of-place and identity
        for the park, it‚Äôs programmatic components, and how they would integrate to create a comprehensive and feasible design.</li>
